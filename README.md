## Hi there ðŸ‘Š

It's-a me Bruno!

I am a computer scientist, sysadmin, solutions architect, linux nerd :penguin: and part-time wizard :mage_man:.

I currently work as a Manager Solutions Architect at [CÃ¢mara Municipal de Curitiba](https://cmc.pr.gov.br) leading a team of automation engineers in our cloud-first transformation. Hands-on leader focused on building resilient systems and empowering the team to serve our community.
